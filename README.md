## What Is Gemini Canvas?

At its heart, Gemini Canvas is designed as a single, unified workspace where you and the Gemini AI can collaborate in real-time to produce documents and generate code. Think of it as a digital blank slate that comes with a powerful AI assistant built right in. You can write an essay, draft a blog post, or code a small project. It updates your work instantly.

### Writing with Canvas

One of the best things about Canvas is how it helps with writing. I started a draft by simply typing my ideas, and the tool offered suggestions to make my text clearer and more engaging. With quick editing tools, I could easily adjust the tone, length, and format of my writing.

### Coding and Creating

As someone who dabbles in coding, I was excited to test the code generation feature. I asked Gemini Canvas to create a simple webpage layout, and within moments, it generated HTML code with a live preview. I could instantly see how my changes affected the output. This feature makes coding much more interactive and fun — especially for beginners who want to learn by doing.
